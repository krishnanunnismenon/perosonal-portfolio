                            This may be the beginning of me who gets <span>interested in things that is very new</span>. When I tried learning how to play the guitar for the first time things where not looking that good.
                            I told myself that learning everything by oneself on their own is not something that can be done by me. Eventually over time with each failure while plucking and strumming on the strings and 
                            <span>with enough time and effort we could be able to learn anything</span> (Maybe not in the peak level but a satisfactory one)

                            An area where I consider myself as <span>an individual who absolutely loves and craves for failure</span>. Tried deliberately with different sports which  includes
                            Football, Karate, Badminton, Chess and many other things. Maybe if I have focused on just one of the things then I could have achieved something greater in it,
                            but luckily or unluckily my curiosity doesn't stop me from exploring some other fields which doesn't make any sense.

                            I still remember the time when I was in my 10th standard and I had an option to choose both Maths as well as Computer as an optional subject
                            with Commerce. Without any hesitation I chose mathematics thinking computer would never be a thing that would be any interest for me....but here
